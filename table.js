                        It also autocancels late, only doing so in a double jump. On hit it can lead to combos from down tilt, and it can condition the opponent into blocking making it good for granting grab opportunities.

The shots decay in damage and knockback based on the opponent's distance from Joker, dealing no knockback at the furthest distance. The button can be held to fire multiple times; additionally, Joker can dodge between shots
                    by tilting the control stick horizontally, with each use causing the dodge to slow down (much like a roll or sidestep). If he is in midair, he can either fire in a circle around himself (in a similar fashion to <a href="/Bayonetta_(SSBU)"
                        title="Bayonetta (SSBU)">Bayonetta</a>'s Bullet Arts up aerial) by tilting up, or below himself in a corkscrewing fashion by tilting down. On the ground, Joker can also press the jump button to perform a diagonal jump while rapidly
                    firing shots downwards. When Arsene is out, it becomes <b>Gun Special</b>, where it fires three bullets with each shot for the standard version, and two bullets per shot for the aerial downward version. Both Gun and Gun Special have
                    penetrative properties, meaning they can pass through multiple opponents, and the downward aerial version in particular,is notorious for its sheer versatility: it can counter combos and juggles, edgeguarding effectively, and rack up
                    damage quickly, as Gun has low ending lag and is spammable when used in the air. The closest version of Gun can also lock opponents.

                    damage over time. Eiha has low knockback, but due to it being vertical it can function as a niche KO option near the upper blast line.

                    upwards or at a angle (again depending on input) using Arsene's wings. It has no hitboxes, therefore dealing no damage or knockback, but grants a long period of <a href="/Intangibility" title="Intangibility">intangibility</a> on startup
                    (frames 1-25 if used on the ground; frames 3-25 if used in midair). Wings of Rebellion also travels considerable distance, going higher than most recovery up specials and being able to recover far below the stage.

                    Joker performd a darkness-infused backhanded swipe at the end of the move that weakly launches opponents away. It quickly refills the Rebellion Gauge to summon Arsene, and when he is summoned, he will power up Joker's special attacks
                    and attack with him, significantly increasing the damage, range and power of his attacks and giving him a large advantage state compared to the rest of the cast, similarly to Rosalina's Luma, although he cannot be sent out as he follows
